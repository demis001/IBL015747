\title{Map between Manufacturer Identifiers and Entrez Gene}
\description{
  IBL015747ENTREZID is an R object that provides mappings between
  manufacturer identifiers and Entrez Gene identifiers.
}
\details{
  Each manufacturer identifier is mapped to a vector of Entrez Gene identifiers. An
  \code{NA} is assigned to those manufacturer identifiers that can not be mapped
  to an Entrez Gene identifier at this time.
  
  If a given manufacturer identifier can be mapped to different Entrez Gene identifiers
  from various sources, we attempt to select the common identifiers. If a
  concensus cannot be determined, we select the smallest identifier.
  
  Mappings were based on data provided by: Entrez Gene  
  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA  
  With a date stamp from the source of: 2015-Sep27
